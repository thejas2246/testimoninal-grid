              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h1>
            <p> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
              the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

            <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
            <p> ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
              professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
              could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend! ‚Äù

            <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
              learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>
            <p>
              ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
              gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
              an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù
